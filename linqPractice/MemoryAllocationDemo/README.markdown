# üìò Memory Allocation in C# (Stack vs. Heap Deep Dive)

Welcome to the **C# Memory Allocation Learning Playground** ‚Äî a hands-on, Feynman-style demo that explores how C# manages memory with **stack** and **heap**. Think of memory as a two-story house: the stack is a tidy, fast attic for quick tasks, while the heap is a spacious basement for long-term storage! üè† This deep dive helps you understand memory allocation to write efficient, bug-free code and avoid performance pitfalls.

---

## üß† Why This Matters

C# uses two memory regions:
- **Stack**: Fast, small, temporary storage for value types and function calls.
- **Heap**: Larger, slower storage for reference types, managed by the Garbage Collector.

Understanding stack vs. heap helps you:
- Optimize performance.
- Debug unexpected behavior (e.g., shared references).
- Write memory-efficient code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Value vs. Reference Types
**Concept**: Value types store data directly; reference types store a reference to data.

| Concept | Value Type | Reference Type |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Stored In** | Stack | Heap |
| **Examples** | `int`, `bool`, `struct` | `class`, `array`, `string` |
| **Assigned By** | Copy | Reference (pointer) |
| **Default Nullability** | Cannot be `null` | Can be `null` |
| **Garbage Collected** | No | Yes |

**Code Example**:
```csharp
public class PersonRef { public string Name { get; set; } public int Age { get; set; } }

int a = 10;
int b = a;
b = 20;

PersonRef p1 = new PersonRef { Name = "Alice", Age = 25 };
PersonRef p2 = p1;
p2.Age = 30;

Console.WriteLine($"Value Types: a = {a}, b = {b}");
Console.WriteLine($"Reference Types: p1.Age = {p1.Age}, p2.Age = {p2.Age}");
```

**Output**:
```plaintext
Value Types: a = 10, b = 20
Reference Types: p1.Age = 30, p2.Age = 30
```

**Memory Visualization**:
```
Stack:                    Heap:
a ‚Üí 10
b ‚Üí 20
p1 ‚Üí (ref) ‚îê             { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 }
p2 ‚Üí (ref) ‚îò
```

**Key Notes**:
- **Value types**: `a` and `b` are independent stack copies.
- **Reference types**: `p1` and `p2` point to the same heap object.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Structs vs. Classes
**Concept**: Structs are value types; classes are reference types.

| Feature | Struct | Class |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Type** | Value | Reference |
| **Allocation** | Stack | Heap |
| **Copy Behavior** | Copies entire data | Copies reference |
| **Inheritance** | No | Yes |
| **Performance** | Faster for small data | Slower, more flexible |
| **Examples** | `DateTime`, `Point` | `Person`, `Student` |

**Code Example**:
```csharp
public struct PointStruct { public int X, Y; }
public class PointClass { public int X, Y; }

PointStruct s1 = new PointStruct { X = 3, Y = 5 };
PointStruct s2 = s1;
s2.X = 10;

PointClass c1 = new PointClass { X = 3, Y = 5 };
PointClass c2 = c1;
c2.X = 10;

Console.WriteLine($"Struct: s1 = ({s1.X}, {s1.Y}), s2 = ({s2.X}, {s2.Y})");
Console.WriteLine($"Class: c1 = ({c1.X}, {c1.Y}), c2 = ({c2.X}, {c2.Y})");
```

**Output**:
```plaintext
Struct: s1 = (3, 5), s2 = (10, 5)
Class: c1 = (10, 5), c2 = (10, 5)
```

**Key Notes**:
- **Structs**: Copy data, so `s1` and `s2` are independent.
- **Classes**: Copy references, so `c1` and `c2` share the same object.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mutable vs. Immutable
**Concept**: Mutable types can change; immutable types create new instances.

**Code Example**:
```csharp
string s = "Hello";
string s2 = s;
s2 += " World";
Console.WriteLine($"s = {s}, sCopy = {s2}");
```

**Output**:
```plaintext
s = Hello, sCopy = Hello World
```

**Key Notes**:
- **Immutable**: `string` creates a new instance for modifications (e.g., `s2` doesn‚Äôt affect `s`).
- **Mutable**: Classes like `List<T>` or custom classes allow in-place changes.
- Immutability enhances thread safety and predictability.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Boxing & Unboxing
**Concept**: Boxing wraps a value type in a reference type (`object`); unboxing extracts it.

**Code Example**:
```csharp
int x = 42;
object obj = x; // Boxing
int y = (int)obj; // Unboxing
Console.WriteLine($"num = {x}, boxed = {obj}, unboxed = {y}");
```

**Output**:
```plaintext
num = 42, boxed = 42, unboxed = 42
```

**Memory Visualization**:
```
Stack: x = 42
Heap: object { value = 42 }
```

**Key Notes**:
- **Boxing**: Allocates heap memory, copies the value, and is slower.
- **Unboxing**: Requires a cast, can throw `InvalidCastException` if incorrect.
- **Performance Tip**: Avoid boxing in loops (e.g., `List<object>` with `int`).

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Garbage Collection
**Concept**: The .NET Garbage Collector (GC) reclaims heap memory for unreferenced objects.

**Code Example**:
```csharp
PersonRef p = new PersonRef { Name = "Alice", Age = 25 };
p = null; // Eligible for GC
Console.WriteLine("üßπ Objects on the heap are automatically cleaned up.");
```

**Key Notes**:
- GC runs automatically when memory pressure increases.
- Avoid calling `GC.Collect()` unless diagnosing memory leaks.
- Only heap objects (reference types) are garbage-collected.

## ‚ö° Quick Recap

| Concept | Stack | Heap |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Stores** | Value types, references, call frames | Objects, arrays |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Slower |
| **Size** | Small | Large |
| **Managed By** | Compiler | Garbage Collector |
| **Lifespan** | Ends when method returns | Until no references remain |

## üí¨ Interview Highlights

| Question | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| ‚ùì **What‚Äôs the difference between stack and heap?** | Stack stores value types and call data; heap stores reference type objects, managed by the GC. |
| ‚ùì **Is `string` a value or reference type?** | Reference type, but immutable, so modifications create new instances. |
| ‚ùì **What is boxing?** | Wrapping a value type (e.g., `int`) into an `object`, allocating heap memory. |
| ‚ùì **Do structs live only on the stack?** | Usually, but they can live on the heap when boxed or as fields in a class. |
| ‚ùì **What is GC and when does it run?** | Garbage Collector reclaims unreferenced heap objects, running automatically based on memory pressure. |
| ‚ùì **What happens if you box a value type in a collection?** | Each value type is boxed, increasing heap memory usage and slowing performance. |
| ‚ùì **Why avoid mutable structs?** | Mutable structs can lead to confusing behavior, as copies don‚Äôt share changes, unlike classes. |
| ‚ùì **How does immutability affect GC?** | Immutable objects (e.g., `string`) may create more temporary objects, increasing GC workload. |
| ‚ùì **What‚Äôs the impact of large structs on the stack?** | Large structs can cause stack overflow or slow copying, as they‚Äôre duplicated on the stack. |
| ‚ùì **How does `ref` affect value types in memory?** | `ref` passes a value type by reference, allowing direct modification without copying. |

## üß™ Practice Challenges

1. Create a `struct` and a `class` with identical properties, then compare their copy behavior on stack vs. heap.
2. Write a loop that boxes `int` values into a `List<object>`, then measure performance vs. `List<int>`.
3. Demonstrate immutability by creating a `string`-like class with a `With` method for modifications.
4. Simulate garbage collection by creating and nulling objects, then observe memory usage (e.g., using diagnostics).
